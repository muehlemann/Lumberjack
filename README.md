# Lumberjack

*THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT*

Lumberjack is a simple game designed with CoroanSDK. The point of the game is to place platforms on the screen and make the log go as high as possible. Make sure that you avoid the saws and remember that you can only have seven platforms on the screen at once.
